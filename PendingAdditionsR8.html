<H1>Pending Gene Additions</H1>
Here is an Excel spreadsheet with additional embryo mutants not included in
the SeedGenes database.  Some of these additions represent &quot;Confirmed&quot; or &quot;Not
Confirmed&quot; mutants that were added to our datasets after the main database was
updated in December, 2010.  Others represent &quot;Promising&quot; mutants that require
further validation before their identity status can be upgraded.  This
spreadsheet will be updated on a regular basis to keep track of valuable
additions to the cumulative dataset of EMB genes in Arabidopsis.

<h1>Pending Alias Additions</h1>
Here is an Excel spreadsheet with additional alias symbols for EMB genes of
Arabidopsis.  These symbols were added to our datasets after the main database
was updated in December, 2010.  Additional symbols for EMB genes can be found
at TAIR (<a href='http://www.arabidopsis.org'>www.arabidopsis.org</a>).

<h1>Pending Gene Identity Upgrades</h1>

Here is an Excel spreadsheet of genes that were listed as &quot;Not Confirmed&quot; in
  the December 2010 update of the SeedGenes database but were later upgraded
  to a &quot;Confirmed&quot; gene identity status.
