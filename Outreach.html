<h1>SeedGenes Outreach Activities</h1>

SeedGenes personnel have been involved in three major programs:


<h3>1. High school students in SeedGenes project research.</h3>

<p>Four high school students have contributed to the research presented in SeedGenes.  Two of these were included as co-authors on a paper published in Plant Physiology describing the first sequence-based map of genes with mutant phenotypes in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.  That large-scale project would not have been initiated without their active involvement.  Another high school student is currently participating in gene expression studies at VBI.      

<h3>2. Plant biotechnology at Stillwater Junior High School.</h3>

<p>A special unit on <i>Arabidopsis</i> and plant biotechnology was developed for the <a href="http://plantbionet.okstate.edu/outreach/arabframeset1.html">Extended Studies program</a> in collaboration with David Demezas at Oklahoma State University and Trixie Barnes at Stillwater Junior High School.  

<h3>3. High school curriculum development.</h3>

<p>We are continuing to work on incorporating <i>Arabidopsis</i> genetics into the curriculum of the <a href="http://www.ossm.edu/">Oklahoma School for Science and Mathematics</a> in Oklahoma City, a special high school for advanced students.  <!-- Click here to see the initial results of this program.  -->
